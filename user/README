The purpose of these two C programs is testing the device driver.

Both programs must be run after sudoing.

/-------------------------------------writer.c---------------------------------/
writer.c receives 3 input:
1) The pathname of a device file handled by the device driver
2) A write timeout (expressed in milliseconds)
3) A string: "manual" or "auto"
If the "manual" string is provided, the program starts a command line when
the user can insert message to be posted into the device file.
If the "auto" string is provided, the program posts every second a random number
in the device file. (The store is actually immediate or delayed according to the
provided input).

In the "manual" version for each write() the return value and possibly the errno
are printed. Some input are special:
-REVOKE_DELAYED_MESSAGES causes the revoke of the delayed messages related to 
 the current I/O session.
-CLOSE close the file descriptor and exit. This causes the invocation of flush()
 so the delayed messages along any sessions should be revoked and the readers
 waiting for messages along any sessions should be unblocked.
 
/-----------------------------------reader.c-----------------------------------/
reader.c receives 2 input:
1) The pathname of a device file handled by the device driver
2) A read timeout (expressed in milliseconds)
The program tries to read the given device file in a infinite loop until
arrested manually. For each read() attempt the return value is printed.
